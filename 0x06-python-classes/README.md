## 	 Python - Classes and Objects
Python is also an object-oriented language since its beginning. It allows us to develop applications using an Object-Oriented approach. 
Major principles of object-oriented programming system are given below.
- class
- Objects
- Methods
- inheritance 
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction
- Encapsulation
***
#### Class
It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods. Its collection of objects
#### Objects
The object is an entity that has state and behavior. 
#### Method
The method is a function that is associated with an object. In Python, a method is not unique to class instances. Any object type can have methods.
#### Inheritance
It specifies that the child object acquires all the properties and behaviors of the parent object.
#### Polymorphism
Polymorphism contains two words "poly" and "morphs". Poly means many, and morph means shape. By polymorphism, we understand that one task can be performed in different ways.
#### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is also an essential aspect of object-oriented programming. It is used to restrict access to methods and variables.
#### Data abstractrion
Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities. ***
