## File descriptions
- 0-positive_or_negative.py : assign a random signed number to the variable
  number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print
  whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

- 1-last_digit.py :  assign a random signed number to the variable number each
  time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last
  digit of the number stored in the variable number.

- 2-print_alphabet.py : t prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed
  by a new line.

- 3-print_alphabt.py : program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase,
  not followed by a new line.

- 4-print_hexa.py : prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in
  hexadecimal (as in the following example)

- 5-print_comb2.py :  program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

- 6-print_comb3.py : program that prints all possible different combinations of
  two digits.

- 7-islower.py :  function that checks for lowercase character.

- 8-uppercase.py : unction that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new
  line.

- 9-print_last_digit.py : function that prints the last digit of a number.

-10-add.py :  function that adds two integers and returns the result.

- 11-pow.py : function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

- 12-fizzbuzz.py : function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a
space.

- 13-insert_number.c, lists.h :  function in C that inserts a number into a
  sorted singly linked list

- 100-print_tebahpla.py :  program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse
  order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in
  uppercase) , not followed by a new line.

- 101-remove_char_at.py : function that creates a copy of the string, removing
  the character at the position n (not the Python way, the “C array index”).

- 102-magic_calculation.py : Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c):
  that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:
